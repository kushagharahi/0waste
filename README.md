## Ever been confused when confronted with these bins?
![Landfill, Compost, Recycling bins](https://i.imgur.com/tq6NurE.jpg)
- 9.1 billion tons of recyclable plastic is produced worldwide every year
- 79% of plastic produced will ultimately reside in a landfill
- Only 9% of plastic is recycled

## The Solution: A garbage classification application and website powered by image recognition through machine learning and neural networks.

# How 0waste works
- Open the 0waste web app
- Take a picture of a piece of garbage
- Get garbage classification and use the correct bin to save the planet!

## Stage 1: âœ… Garbage classification through image recognition app 
This serves as both a proof of concept, and assists users to correctly recycle/compost trash that usually goes to the landfill.

## Stage 2: Build a garbage can with automatic landfill, compost, and recycling sorting 
This eliminates the burden on the user to pick the correct bin and guarantees sorted garbage.   

## Stage 3: Partner with trash collection facilities to build an automated sorting machine
This further eliminates the burden on the user to have sorted garbage.
